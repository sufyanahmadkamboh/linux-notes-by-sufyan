# üîó Soft Links vs Hard Links in Linux

Linux supports two types of links: **Soft (symbolic)** and **Hard** links.  
Links are pointers that allow multiple references to the same file, making file management more flexible.

---

## üìå What is an Inode?

Every file in Linux is represented by an **inode** (index node).  
- **Inode stores metadata**: permissions, owner, size, disk blocks, etc.  
- File **name** is just a pointer to an inode.  

Links are simply **different names pointing to the same inode or data**.

---

## üîó Hard Links

- A **hard link** is another name for the same file (same inode).  
- Both original file and hard link point to the **same data blocks**.  
- If you delete the original file, the hard link still works (data exists until all links are deleted).  
- Can only be created **within the same filesystem/partition**.  

### Create Hard Link

ln file1.txt hardlink1.txt

Check Inode Numbers
ls -li


Both files will have the same inode number.

## üîó Soft Links (Symbolic Links)

A soft link (symlink) is like a shortcut (similar to Windows shortcuts).

It points to the original file by name/path, not by inode.

If the original file is deleted, the symlink becomes a broken link.

Can link across different filesystems/partitions.

Useful for creating shortcuts or redirection paths.

Create Soft Link
ln -s file1.txt softlink1.txt

Check Links
ls -l


Soft links will show with -> pointing to the original file:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 user group   8 Sep 24 15:00 softlink1.txt -> file1.txt

## üìä Comparison: Hard Links vs Soft Links

Feature	Hard Link	Soft Link (Symbolic)
Points to	Inode (actual data)	File name/path
Inode number	Same as original	Different
Works across filesystems	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
If original deleted	Still works (data intact)	Broken link
Can link directories	‚ùå Not usually	‚úÖ Yes
Size	Same size as original	Very small (just stores path)
‚úÖ Examples
Create a File
echo "Hello Linux" > file1.txt

Hard Link
ln file1.txt hard1.txt
ls -li


Both files have the same inode and content.

Soft Link
ln -s file1.txt soft1.txt
ls -l


Soft link points to file1.txt.

Delete original file:

rm file1.txt
cat hard1.txt   # ‚úÖ Works
cat soft1.txt   # ‚ùå Broken link

## ‚úÖ Try it Yourself

Create a file data.txt.

Make a hard link hard.txt and a soft link soft.txt.

Compare their inode numbers using ls -li.

Delete data.txt and check which links still work.

Try making a soft link across directories.

# üñ•Ô∏è Process Monitoring with `ps` Command

The `ps` (process status) command is used to **view running processes** in Linux. It provides information like **PID, TTY, CPU usage, memory, and the command** that started the process. It‚Äôs a key tool for monitoring and troubleshooting.

-p <pid>	Show process by PID
-o <format>	Customize output fields
-T	Show threads

## ‚úÖ Try it Yourself

Task 1: Run ps to see only your shell and ps command.

Task 2: Use ps -ef to view all system processes.

Task 3: Find your SSH session using ps -u <your-username>.

Task 4: Show top memory-using processes with custom formatting.

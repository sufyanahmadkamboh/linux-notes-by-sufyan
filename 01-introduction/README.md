# Linux Introduction

**Linux** is a UNIX-like kernel used by distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS/Alma, Arch, etc.). Most servers and cloud workloads run Linux due to stability, security, and automation readiness.

**Key ideas**
- Kernel vs distribution
- Shell (bash/zsh), userspace tools (GNU coreutils)
- Files are everything; case-sensitive paths
- Everything mounted under `/`

**Try it**
```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
whoami && id
Checklist

Know your distro and version

Comfort with shell and man pages: man ls

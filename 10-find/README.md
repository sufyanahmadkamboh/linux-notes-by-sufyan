# üîé Linux `find` Command ‚Äì Complete Guide

The `find` command in Linux is one of the most **powerful tools** for searching files and directories based on name, type, size, permissions, modification time, and much more. It allows you to perform **automated actions** (delete, move, execute) on the files it finds.

---

## üìå Basic Syntax

find [path] [options] [expression]

path ‚Üí Directory where the search starts (use / for entire system, . for current directory).

options ‚Üí Flags to control search (e.g., -type, -name).

expression ‚Üí Conditions to match files or directories.

## üöÄ Common Examples

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Find by Name

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find by File Type

Regular files:

find . -type f


Directories:

find . -type d


Symbolic links:

find . -type l

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find by Size

Files larger than 100 MB:

find / -type f -size +100M


Files smaller than 10 KB:

find / -type f -size -10k


Files exactly 1 GB:

find / -type f -size 1G

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Find by Time

Modified in the last 7 days:

find /var/log -type f -mtime -7


Modified more than 30 days ago:

find /var/log -type f -mtime +30


Accessed within 24 hours:

find /home -atime -1

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Find by Permission
